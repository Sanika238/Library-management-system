# Library-management-system
A library management system made to show how Data can be managed in languages like Python. A simple interface opens in Notepad where you can interact with the data in the list and add, delete, search, and manipulate data. It provided me with the understanding of how easy things are in a DBMS rather than coding it via languages.
